## features

Login system - Users must log in or create an account to place bets.
   
Betting system - Users wager their balance before the round begins. A multiplier counts up from 1.00 and users can cash out at any time, multiplying their bet amount by the current multiplier. The multiplier will stop, or crash, at a randomly generated value, and users who have not cashed out yet will lose their entire bet.
  
Accurate Gambling Odds - Every crash value is generated using the same algorithms real casinos use, including a 3% house edge.
  
Live Bet Tracker - Users can see other users betting live. When a user places a bet, their username and bet amount are added to a live table. When the user cashes out, their cash out multiplier and profit are also added.
  
Game History - Displays the crash values of the last 25 games played along with the streak of games with crash values above or below 2.00.
  
Chat - Users who are logged in can send messages to other users through chat
Live Line Graph - Visualization of the current multiplier with respect to time.
